In this lab, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to a real-world dataset (Superstore Sales Dataset). The analysis process included checking for missing values, identifying duplicate records, understanding data types, and generating descriptive statistics.

In addition, univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to explore the distribution of key variables such as Sales and Profit, and to examine the relationships between different features like Quantity and Profit. A correlation matrix was also created to identify potential relationships among numerical variables.

Furthermore, time-based analysis was conducted using the Order Date column to observe monthly sales trends. This helped in understanding how sales performance changes over time.

Overall, the application of EDA techniques provided valuable insights into the dataset and improved the understanding of its structure and patterns before applying any further data analysis or machine learning techniques.
